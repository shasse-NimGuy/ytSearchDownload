Proof of concept for retrieving youtube vidoes from a query with no API usage. 

To use program the either supply a query (ProgramName searchTerm) otherwise defaults to "memes".

Program also does not always query as desired. Probably something to do with the user agent of the get request.

Screenshot included of it working.

Queries must still be formatted how they would in a real youtube search bar (search+search).

Example ytAuto "Linux"

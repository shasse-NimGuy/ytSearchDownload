Proof of concept for retrieving youtube vidoes from a query with no API usage. 

To use program either supply a query (ProgramName url) otherwise defaults to "memes".

Program also doesnt always query as desired. Probobly something to do with the user agent of the get request.

Screenshot included of it working.
